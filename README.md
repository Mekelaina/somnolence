# Somnolence

### Repo for implemenmtation of Somnolence in C.

**big WIP**

**This is also a way for me to learn and practice with C, so my code is probably a mess.** 


### What is Somnolence?

Somnolence is an Esolang based of what i can remember from a programming language I saw in a dream once. hence the name. It is based on explicit statements
and minimal punctuation.
